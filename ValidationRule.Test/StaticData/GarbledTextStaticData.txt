SearchClient Class
Reference
Feedback

A client to interact with an existing Azure search index.

Inheritance
azure.search.documents._headers_mixin.HeadersMixin 
SearchClient
Constructor
Python
Copy
SearchClient(endpoint: str, index_name: str, credential: AzureKeyCredential | AsyncTokenCredential, **kwargs: Any)
Parameters
Expand table
Name	Description

endpoint
Required
	
str

The URL endpoint of an Azure search service



index_name
Required
	
str

The name of the index to connect to



credential
Required
	
AzureKeyCredential or AsyncTokenCredential

A credential to authorize search client requests

Keyword-Only Parameters
Expand table
Name	Description

api_version
	
str

The Search API version to use for requests.



audience
	
str

sets the Audience to use for authentication with Azure Active Directory (AAD). The audience is not considered when using a shared key. If audience is not provided, the public cloud audience will be assumed.

Examples

Creating the SearchClient with an API key.

Python
Copy

   from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
   from azure.search.documents.aio import SearchClient

   service_endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT"]
   index_name = os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME"]
   key = os.environ["AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY"]

   search_client = SearchClient(service_endpoint, index_name, AzureKeyCredential(key))


Methods
Expand table
autocomplete	

Get search auto-completion results from the Azure search index.


close	

Close the session. :return: None :rtype: None


delete_documents	

Delete documents from the Azure search index

Delete removes the specified document from the index. Any field you specify in a delete operation, other than the key field, will be ignored. If you want to remove an individual field from a document, use merge_documents instead and set the field explicitly to None.

Delete operations are idempotent. That is, even if a document key does not exist in the index, attempting a delete operation with that key will result in a 200 status code.


get_document	

Retrieve a document from the Azure search index by its key.


get_document_count	

Return the number of documents in the Azure search index.


index_documents	

Specify a document operations to perform as a batch.

:raises ~azure.search.documents.RequestEntityTooLargeError


merge_documents	

Merge documents in to existing documents in the Azure search index.

Merge updates an existing document with the specified fields. If the document doesn't exist, the merge will fail. Any field you specify in a merge will replace the existing field in the document. This also applies to collections of primitive and complex types.


merge_or_upload_documents	

Merge documents in to existing documents in the Azure search index, or upload them if they do not yet exist.

This action behaves like merge_documents if a document with the given key already exists in the index. If the document does not exist, it behaves like upload_documents with a new document.


search	

Search the Azure search index for documents.


send_request	

Runs a network request using the client's existing pipeline.


suggest	

Get search suggestion results from the Azure search index.


upload_documents	

Upload documents to the Azure search index.

An upload action is similar to an "upsert" where the document will be inserted if it is new and updated/replaced if it exists. All fields are replaced in the update case.

autocomplete

Get search auto-completion results from the Azure search index.

Python
Copy
async autocomplete(search_text: str, suggester_name: str, *, mode: str | AutocompleteMode | None = None, filter: str | None = None, use_fuzzy_matching: bool | None = None, highlight_post_tag: str | None = None, highlight_pre_tag: str | None = None, minimum_coverage: float | None = None, search_fields: List[str] | None = None, top: int | None = None, **kwargs) -> List[Dict]
Parameters

filter
	
str

The OData $filter expression to apply to the search query.



highlight_fields
	
str

The comma-separated list of field names to use for hit highlights. Only searchable fields can be used for hit highlighting.

order_by
	
list[str]

The list of OData $orderby expressions by which to sort the results. Each expression can be either a field name or a call to either the geo.distance() or the search.score() functions. Each expression can be followed by asc to indicate ascending, and desc to indicate descending. The default is ascending order. Ties will be broken by the match scores of documents. If no OrderBy is specified, the default sort order is descending by document match score. There can be at most 32 $orderby clauses.



query_type
	
str or QueryType

A value that specifies the syntax of the search query. The default is 'simple'. Use 'full' if your query uses the Lucene query syntax. Possible values include: 'simple', 'full', "semantic".



scoring_parameters
	
list[str]

The list of parameter values to be used in scoring functions (for example, referencePointParameter) using the format name-values. For example, if the scoring profile defines a function with a parameter called 'mylocation' the parameter string would be "mylocation–122.2,44.8" (without the quotes).



scoring_profile
	
str

The name of a scoring profile to evaluate match scores for matching documents in order to sort the results.



semantic_query
	
str

Allows setting a separate search query that will be solely used for semantic reranking, semantic captions and semantic answers. Is useful for scenarios where there is a need to use different queries between the base retrieval and ranking phase, and the L2 semantic phase.



search_fields
	
list[str]

The list of field names to which to scope the full-text search. When using fielded search (fieldName:searchExpression) in a full Lucene query, the field names of each fielded search expression take precedence over any field names listed in this parameter.



search_mode
	
str or SearchMode

A value that specifies whether any or all of the search terms must be matched in order to count the document as a match. Possible values include: 'any', 'all'.



query_answer
	
str or QueryAnswerType

This parameter is only valid if the query type is 'semantic'. If set, the query returns answers extracted from key passages in the highest ranked documents. Possible values include: "none", "extractive".



query_answer_count
	
int

This parameter is only valid if the query type is 'semantic' and query answer is 'extractive'. Configures the number of answers returned. Default count is 1.



query_answer_threshold
	
float

This parameter is only valid if the query type is 'semantic' and query answer is 'extractive'. Configures the number of confidence threshold. Default count is 0.7.



query_caption

bool

This parameter is only valid if the query type is 'semantic' when query caption is set to 'extractive'. Determines whether highlighting is enabled. Defaults to 'true'.



semantic_configuration_name
	
str

The name of the semantic configuration that will be used when processing documents for queries of type semantic.



select
	
list[str]

The list of fields to retrieve. If unspecified, all fields marked as retrievable in the schema are included.



skip
	
int

The number of search results to skip. This value cannot be greater than 100,000. If you need to scan documents in sequence, but cannot use $skip due to this limitation, consider using $orderby on a totally-ordered key and $filter with a range query instead.



top
	
int

The number of search results to retrieve. This can be used in conjunction with $skip to implement client-side paging of search results. If results are truncated due to server-side paging, the response will include a continuation token that can be used to issue another Search request for the next page of results.



scoring_statistics
	
str or ScoringStatistics

A value that specifies whether we want to calculate scoring statistics (such as document frequency) globally for more consistent scoring, or locally, for lower latency. The default is 'local'. Use 'global' to aggregate scoring statistics globally before scoring. Using global scoring statistics can increase latency of search queries. Possible values include: "local", "global".



session_id
	
str

A value to be used to create a sticky session, which can help getting more consistent results. As long as the same sessionId is used, a best-effort attempt will be made to target the same replica set. Be wary that reusing the same sessionID values repeatedly can interfere with the load balancing of the requests across replicas and adversely affect the performance of the search service. The value used as sessionId cannot start with a '_' character.



semantic_error_mode

Parameters
Expand table
Name	Description

request
Required
	
HttpRequest

The network request you want to make.

Keyword-Only Parameters
Expand table
Name	Description

stream
	
bool

Whether the response payload will be streamed. Defaults to False.

Returns
Expand table

suggest

Get search suggestion results from the Azure search index.

Python
Copy
async suggest(search_text: str, suggester_name: str, *, filter: str | None = None, use_fuzzy_matching: bool | None = None, highlight_post_tag: str | None = None, highlight_pre_tag: str | None = None, minimum_coverage: float | None = None, order_by: List[str] | None = None, search_fields: List[str] | None = None, select: List[str] | None = None, top: int | None = None, **kwargs) -> List[Dict]
Parameters
Expand table
Name	Description

search_text
Required
	
str

Required. The search text to use to suggest documents. Must be at least 1 character, and no more than 100 characters.



suggester_name
Required
	
str

Required. The name of the suggester as specified in the suggesters collection that's part of the index definition.

Keyword-Only Parameters
Expand table
Name	Description

filter
	
str

An OData expression that filters the documents considered for suggestions.



use_fuzzy_matching
	
bool

A value indicating whether to use fuzzy matching for the suggestions query. Default is false. When set to true, the query will find terms even if there's a substituted or missing character in the search text. While this provides a better experience in some scenarios, it comes at a performance cost as fuzzy suggestions queries are slower and consume more resources.



highlight_post_tag
	
str

A string tag that is appended to hit highlights. Must be set with highlightPreTag. If omitted, hit highlighting of suggestions is disabled.



highlight_pre_tag
	
str

A string tag that is prepended to hit highlights. Must be set with highlightPostTag. If omitted, hit highlighting of suggestions is disabled.



minimum_coverage
	
float

A number between 0 and 100 indicating the percentage of the index that must be covered by a suggestions query in order for the query to be reported as a success. This parameter can be useful for ensuring search availability even for services with only one replica. The default is 80.



order_by
	
list[str]

The list of OData $orderby expressions by which to sort the results. Each expression can be either a field name or a call to either the geo.distance() or the search.score() functions. Each expression can be followed by asc to indicate ascending, or desc to indicate descending. The default is ascending order. Ties will be broken by the match scores of documents. If no $orderby is specified, the default sort order is descending by document match score. There can be at most 32 $orderby clauses.



search_fields
	
list[str]

The list of field names to search for the specified search text. Target fields must be included in the specified suggester.



select
	
list[str]

The list of fields to retrieve. If unspecified, only the key field will be included in the results.



top
	
int

The number of suggestions to retrieve. The value must be a number between 1 and 100. The default is 5.

Returns
Expand table
Type	Description

list[dict]
	

List of suggestion results.

Examples

Get search suggestions.

Python
Copy

   from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
   from azure.search.documents.aio import SearchClient

   search_client = SearchClient(service_endpoint, index_name, AzureKeyCredential(key))

   async with search_client:
       results = await search_client.suggest(search_text="coffee", suggester_name="sg")

       print("Search suggestions for 'coffee'")
       for result in results:
           hotel = await search_client.get_document(key=result["hotelId"])
           print("    Text: {} for Hotel: {}".format(repr(result["text"]), hotel["hotelName"]))


upload_documents

Upload documents to the Azure search index.

An upload action is similar to an "upsert" where the document will be inserted if it is new and updated/replaced if it exists. All fields are replaced in the update case.

filter
	
str

An OData expression that filters the documents used to produce completed terms for the Autocomplete result.



use_fuzzy_matching
	
bool

A value indicating whether to use fuzzy matching for the autocomplete query. Default is false. When set to true, the query will find terms even if there's a substituted or missing character in the search text. While this provides a better experience in some scenarios, it comes at a performance cost as fuzzy autocomplete queries are slower and consume more resources.

search_fields
	
list[str]

The list of field names to consider when querying for auto-completed terms. Target fields must be included in the specified suggester.



top
	
int

The number of auto-completed terms to retrieve. This must be a value between 1 and 100. The default is 5.
