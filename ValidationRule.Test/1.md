## Overview
The `ValidationRule.Test` library is designed to ensure that each validation method in the `ContentValidation` library accurately detects specific errors in SDK documentation content.  
Whenever a validation method in the `ContentValidation` library is updated, passing the tests in the `ValidationRule.Test` library is crucial to maintaining the robustness and accuracy of the `ContentValidation` library.

## Code Components

- **TestValidations.cs**  
   Reads configuration data from `LocalHtmlData.json`, provides the corresponding HTML page paths, executes the relevant validation methods, and compares the actual results with the expected outcomes.

- **HTML Folder**  
   Stores HTML files or fragments for testing purposes. These files simulate various error scenarios, allowing validation rules to be thoroughly tested for their effectiveness in identifying issues.

- **LocalHtmlData.json**  
   Serves as the test case configuration file. Each test case specifies the validation rule, the path to the HTML file, and the expected validation results.
