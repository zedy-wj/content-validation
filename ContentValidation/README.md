# Content Validation Library

## Overview
The Content Validation library is the core module of this repository, which contains a wealth of rules for document validation of SDK Microsoft Learn Doc in various (python/java/...) languages.

## Getting started
The current 6 validation rules can fully cover the content validation of [Python SDK Microsoft Learn website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/?view=azure-python), and some rules can be reused on [Java SDK Microsoft Learn website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/?view=azure-java). We will develop more rules in the future to meet the content validation of all language SDKs.

For a detailed introduction to the rules, please refer to the following table. You can view the specific design of the rules in the markdown files of the respective languages.
